**Overview of the Statistical**
    
    The purpose of this analysis is to show our command over the SQLite and SQLAlchemy tools and be able to take data from a SQLite file and extract the data and make readable/accessible to those who will find the data useful to make decision. We had to extract temperature data from two different months from the SQLite folder and display the data and then gather a statical analysis from the gathered data. Using the data will let us know which months are better for the surf company to sell their products.
    
**Results**
  - In the months of June and December according to the data June was hotter, but only slightly on average the data show June with an avrage       temperature of 75 versus December average temperature was 71 degrees.
  - December did have a much lower temperature then June: December had 56 degree low and June had a 64 degree low temperature.
  - Both month had ver similar max high temperature with June having an 85 degree high and December had 83 degree high temperature making the temperature at it hottest very similar in both month.

**Summary**
  Looking at the temperature notice that on average December is colder that June, but it is not significant and I would not alter my business module. I believe by looking at the two temperature data sets from two month that land in two different seasons and then see there is barely any change in the temperature. This makes Oahu a perfect loction for this business and yes it seems that it is a sustainable business from the persective that it is the perfect temperature for ice cream and surfing.
  I would look to expand and would try to get data from other location that may have similar temperature all year round and would look to add a site there. The other aspect I would look for the months all year and check what is the lowest temperature months to see if it get cold in Feburary. I would also check what months has the hottest days so that I can be prepared for those months and determine whether to have more or less inventory and staff or the opposite depending on the results of the data.
